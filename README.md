**BUSN7005 – Part A Referencing Exercise – S2 2024**

**Weighting**: 10%

**Due Date**: 4pm, Thursday August 29, 2024 via Turnitin

**Purpose**:
The Referencing Exercise examines students’ ability to appropriately reference scholarly research, and to identify and organise sources relevant to the completion of the Research Essay. This task supports students in preparing for writing a research essay through developing referencing skills and using academic resources to prepare an essay plan.

This assessment task is to be completed individually.

**Required**:
It is critical that you carefully and correctly use the Harvard referencing system for this assessment. If you are unfamiliar with the Harvard referencing system, the ANU Academic Skills and Learning Centre (ASLC) provides detailed information on referencing on its website. It is strongly advised that you familiarise yourselves with this approach prior to completing this task.

**Part1—Referencing (3 marks)**
Using the ANU Library SuperSearch, Google Scholar, Social Science Research Network (SSRN) or a scholarly internet search engine of your choice, find and download the following two articles. The first article, ‘The Political polarization of Corporate America’, is authored by Fos, Vyacheslav, Kempf, Elisabeth and Tsoutsoura, Margarita. This article is a working paper that became available in 2022. The second article, ‘Non - GAAP Reporting: Evidence from Academia and Current Practice’, is authored by Black, Dirk, Christensen, Theodore, Ciesielski, Jack and Whipple, Benjamin. This article is published in 2018.

Using the first article, write a short summary of no more than 200 words that contains the following:
- (i) A summary of the article by Fos, Vyacheslav, Kempf, Elisabeth and Tsoutsoura, Margarita;
- (ii) A direct quotation from the article by Fos, Vyacheslav, Kempf, Elisabeth and Tsoutsoura, Margarita; that is correctly referenced;
- (iii) A sentence paraphrasing a specific argument made by Fos, Vyacheslav, Kempf, Elisabeth and Tsoutsoura, Margarita that is correctly referenced (i.e. you must re - write a specific argument in your own words and correctly reference this);

You must use the Harvard referencing system for this referencing exercise. The ANU Academic Skills Office has a guide to Harvard Referencing available on their website.

**Part 2 – Reference search (7 marks)**
Using the ANU Library SuperSearch, Google Scholar, SSRN or a scholarly internet search engine of your choice, identify at least 10 additional online scholarly journal articles (excluding the two papers described above) that are relevant to the preparation of your Part B Research Essay. Identify 2 relevant media articles or survey evidence published from credible professional sources (i.e. Harvard Business Review, U.S. Security Exchange Commission (SEC), The Wall Street Journal, etc).

Using these 10 journal articles and 2 media report/evidence, provide the following:
- (i) A list of properly - formatted reference list entries for each of the articles/evidence you have found; and
- (ii) A short statement of the key argument/s of each article/evidence and how you plan to use each of them in your Research Essay (e.g. demonstrate relevance).

We suggest you present this information in the form of a table (i.e. with each reference list entry as a new row, and your short statement about the key argument/use of the article included in the second and third columns). Ensure that this part of your submission is no longer than 2 pages.

You must use the Harvard referencing system. The ANU Academic Skills Office has a guide to Harvard Referencing available on their website.

**Late submissions of this task are not accepted**. Ensure you have allowed sufficient time to upload and submit your assignment prior to the deadline.

**General Information**

**Submission**: Students must submit through the Turnitin system on Wattle. For additional information regarding Turnitin please visit the ANU website.

**Essay Writing**: The Academic Skills and Learning Centre (ASLC) provides a lot of support for students in writing essays through its website and also in - person through booked appointments and drop - in clinics.

**BUSN3001 – Part B Research Essay – S2 2024**

**Weighting**: 25%

**Due Date**: 4pm, Thursday October 10 2024 (Week 10) via Turnitin

**Purpose**: The Research Essay examines students’ ability to identify appropriate scholarly research and media articles, critically analyse this literature and develop written arguments. This task helps students further develop their knowledge of accounting theory and their written communication skills.

This assessment task is to be completed individually.

**Required**:
Your research essay should critically analyze the literature and evidence regarding political polarization and its consequences. It should provide a comprehensive and well - rounded analysis of the connection between political polarization in corporate America and firms' likelihood and quality of non - GAAP disclosure.

In your discussions, ensure to address the following key points clearly:
- Identify and explain how political polarization could influence decision - making processes at the firm level.
- Specifically, regarding non - GAAP reporting, discuss how political polarization affects firms' decisions to issue non - GAAP reports and the quality of these reports.

It is expected that your essay will be broadly researched and your arguments should be well reasoned and evidenced with reference to the existing literature. You are required to use the Harvard referencing system.

The word limit for this research essay is a strict 1,500 words (i.e. there is no 10% margin). This excludes the references at the end of the essay (but includes the in - text references). Marks may be deducted for essays that exceed this word limit.

**Assessment Criteria**:
The Research Essay will be assessed based upon the following criteria (also see Grade Related Descriptors below):
- Evidence of scholarly research: extent of literature review, relevance of articles, substantiation of arguments with references to literature.
- Depth and relevance of discussion: coverage and depth in the focus areas of the essay, demonstration of knowledge and understanding of theory.
- Critical analysis: level of critical analysis, argumentation, originality of ideas and insight.
- Written expression: effective language and writing (including attention to grammar and sentence construction), structure and coherence of the essay as a whole
- Consistency with academic conventions: correct and consistent referencing, formatting and abiding by word count

Note: The criteria listed above are not mutually exclusive but are complementary in the overall assessment of the assignment. A well - written and organised essay will receive a zero mark if it is not relevant to the given topic.

The marking rubric used to assess this Research Essay is provided below.

**Further notes**:
- You do not have to use the same references identified in the Part A Referencing Exercise. We are not looking for you to use a certain number of references for this assessment, but consider the 10 journal articles identified for the Referencing Exercise as a minimum or starting point for your research. However, we are looking for quality over quantity in terms of the references used: it is more important to show that you understand and critically analyse the resources you have found than listing many that you only superficially discuss.
- Plagiarism and insufficient referencing are not tolerated. We expect a high standard in terms of referencing in this assessment, as the Referencing Exercise/Essay Plan provided students the opportunity to develop these skills. Students are encouraged to use the Turnitin Originality Report function to check the work they plan to submit in the lead - up to the submission date, and ensure their research essay is entirely their own work. Ensure you allow sufficient time for Turnitin to complete this report when planning your essay submission. Instances of Academic Misconduct will be reported and dealt with according to ANU Academic Misconduct Policy and Processes.
- It is critical that you carefully and correctly use the Harvard referencing system for this assessment. If you are unfamiliar with the Harvard referencing system, the ANU Academic Skills and Learning Centre (ASLC) provides detailed information on referencing on its website.
